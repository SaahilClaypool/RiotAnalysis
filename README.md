# Riot Analysis

This is an (old) repository that contains the python scripts used
to pull data from the riot API and investigate how different 
champions perform with different amounts of relative gold. 

See the writeup [here](./writeup.pdf) 


*Note*: The code in the reopository may no longer work, depending on how the RIOT API has changed. The original data is kept in the data.zip folder
